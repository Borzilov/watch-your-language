# Scopes
Perhaps one of the most fundamental things you'll need to quickly come to writing bulletproof code and being a better developer.

If you do understand scopes, you do understand where variables/functions are accessible, you are able to change the scope of your codeâ€™s context and be able to write faster and more maintainable code, as well as debug much faster.

JavaScript is in fact a *compiled* language instead of  a *"dynamic"* or *"interpreted"* language, like it is described most of the times. In this chapter we'll see how the JavaScript engine affects how variables and functions are defined and how these are accessed.

## What it is
Scope is what we call a *set of rules* that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up. It refers to the current context of your code and can be *globally* or *locally* defined.

There are two kinds of look-ups. The LHS (left-hand-side) reference and the RHS (right-hand-side) look-up.

## LHS and RHS

**LHS** (left-hand-side) reference occurs every time you are trying to assign a value to a variable. Think of it like **"who's the target of the assignment"**

**RHS** (right-hand-side) look-up occurs every time you are trying to access to the value from a variable. Think of it like **"who's the source of the assignment"**

### LHS example

Since JavaScript is compiled, its Engine first compiles code before it executes, spliting up statements like ```var a = 2;``` (*VariableDeclaration*) into two separate steps:

 1. First, ```var a``` (*Identifier*)  to declare it in that Scope. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution.
 2. Later, ```a = 2``` (*AssignmentExpression*) to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.

### RHS example
LHS and RHS doesn't necessarily mean "left/right side of the = assignment operator". For example ```console.log( a );``` is a RHS reference to the variable ```a```. Here we are looking up to retrieve the value of ```a```so that can be  passed to the ```console.log(...)```.

### LHS && RHS example

```javascript
function foo(a) {
    console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );
```

1. Here there's a LHS look-up for ```foo``` which is executed
2. There's a implied ```a = 2```, performing a LHS look-up for ```a```
3. There's a RHS look-up for the ```console``` object, and a property resolution for the method ```log```
4. There's a RHS look-up for the ```a``` which value is passed as an argument to ```console.log(...)```

## Global scope
```javascript
// global scope
var name = 'John';
```

When you are writting your first JavaScript line, you're on the *global scope*!! **DANGER! DANGER!**.

Many people says that global socpe is bad, but in fact it is your friend. You need it to create modules/APIs that are available across scopes.

With global scope and namespacing you can develop real cool and well structured applications.

### JS namespacing example
**Using Object Literal Notation**
```javascript
var calculator = {
 sum: function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
 },
 subtract: function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
 }
};

calculator.sum(1, 1); // 2
```

**Using Module Pattern**
```javascript
var calculator = (function(){
 function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
 };

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
 }

return {
 sum: sum,
 subtract: subtract,
}
}());
```
