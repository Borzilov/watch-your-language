# Scopes
Perhaps one of the most fundamental things you'll need to quickly come to writing bulletproof code and being a better developer.

If you do understand scopes, you do understand where variables/functions are accessible, you are able to change the scope of your codeâ€™s context and be able to write faster and more maintainable code, as well as debug much faster.

JavaScript is in fact a *compiled* language instead of  a *"dynamic"* or *"interpreted"* language, like it is described most of the times. In this chapter we'll see how the JavaScript engine affects how variables and functions are defined and how these are accessed.

## What it is
Scope is what we call a *set of rules* that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up.

There are two kinds of look-ups. The LHS (left-hand-side) reference, when you are doing an assigning to a variable and, in the other hand, the RHS look-up (right-hand-side), when you are retrieving a variable value.

Since JavaScript is compiled, its Engine first compiles code before it executes, spliting up statements like ```var a = 2;``` into two separate steps:

 1. First, var a to declare it in that Scope. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution.
 2. Later, a = 2 to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.

## Global scope

## Compiler Theory

```javascript
function() {
  console.log(foo); // undefined instead of "ReferenceError: foo is not defined"
  var foo = 'bar';
}
```
