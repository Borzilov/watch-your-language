# Watch your language!

A course about JavaScript fundamentals, based on “You don’t know JS” book series from Kyle Simpson where we’ll take a practical and interactive approach so you don’t get bored and really learn what JavaScript is made of.

Each of the following topics should not take longer than 1 hour and must be as much practical as possible. All the material related to these topics will be available at GitLab “watch-your-language” repo.
